this repository contains files of code and projects, that were done in the second semester of my study.
Grundlage digitale Medien was a course which taught us the basics about image processing and did some exercises on how to manipulate an image using java and java frameworks.
each exercise was about a specific topic that we covered in the class during lectures.
each exercise is in its own file in the master branch
